# Gm-C voltage controlled filters
First and second order Gm-C filters designed in Orcad/PSPICE, using 1st level MOS model

This is an extracurricular project I've personally designed for my analog electronic course, at Politecnico di Bari (Italy).

Various simulation profile are provided, in order to trace the performance of the filter when varying parameters as the transconductance of the OTAs (by changing the control tension on the mosfet that provides the polarizzation current to the differential couple of the OTA) and the C2/C1 ratio, which leads to various Q values for the second order filter.

I'll try to provide more infos on this project, updating this readme when I'll have a little free time.
